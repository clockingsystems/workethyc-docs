# Welcome To The Workethyc Docs
 
<br></br>
The Workethyc team give a strong priority to curating comprehensive documentation to empower our users. Our belief is that by providing detailed documentation, we enable you to better navigate the software, understand its functionalities, and grasp any specialized terminology related to Workethyc or time and attendance.
<br></br>
Nonetheless, we consider documentation as a backup plan. Our primary goal is to build the software in a way that ensures an exceptional user experience. While our platform is still in its early stages, we acknowledge that some functions and settings may not be as intuitive as they could be while we finish building them.
<br></br>
In just the past month, we've rolled out more than 20 updates to enhance the platform, and we continue to actively work on making it as user-friendly as possible. Your feedback and suggestions are always valued, and without them we can't build the platform we've set out to.
<br></br>
